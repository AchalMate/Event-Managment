	Event management of birthday parties, events and celebrations. Learn how to organize birthday events by yourself or what professional event managers can do to assure a successful party. Details about all planning steps and potential mistakes. Birthday events recognize the milestones in a person’s life. These festivities can be casual or formal. They may be intimate, with just a few close friends and family; or they can be grand events. There are two basic types of birthday parties: children’s and adults’, and each present its own set of challenges.

<div class="imagecaption"><h3><u><font color="red">Anniversary Management</font></u></h3></a>
	Wedding anniversary events celebrate important milestones in a couple’s life together, and provide an opportunity for friends and relatives to join in celebrating that milestone. While most anniversary events occur at milestone intervals such as 10 years, 25 years, or 50 years, any anniversary can be a celebration. For many couples, the anniversary celebration includes a renewal of vows. This may be quite similar to an actual Wedding, with all the same detailed facets to coordinate Flowers, Décor, Music, and Photography, as well as details of the reception. Almost all wedding anniversary events include a reception. They are commonly held in an “open house” format.

<div class="imagecaption"><h3><u><font color="red">Annual Gathering Management</font></u></h3></a>
	The School Annual Day Celebrations do not fare well as the representation of Indian culture. Culture is not mere traditions. Everything learnt by a man is a culture. India has a rich culture in the form of festivals, dances, singing and folk lore. Why not we bring those into the classroom? Incidents in the life of great personalities could a good theme for annual day functions. Having different folk artists to perform and expose the children to different folk lore. The Bharata Natyam Mudras and their meanings could be an interesting subject for celebration. The stories from Mahabharatha, Ramayana, Upanishads or Bhagavata could be an unequalled theme. If the children are not able to talk on the stage there could be a tableau.
